			<h1>Bombshell</h1>
			<div id="opis">
				<p>
					Bombshell is a top-down action game with RPG elements currently in development by Interceptor Entertainment and published by 3D Realms. The game is scheduled for release
					on January 29, 2016, and is using the Unreal Engine 3 engine. The game is scheduled for release on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The game was conceived during Gearbox Software's lawsuit against Interceptor regarding the video game Duke Nukem: Mass Destruction. 
					Interceptor was working on the game for the PlayStation 4 and PC, however due to a lawsuit by Gearbox Software, the game's name was
					changed to Bombshell and the main character was changed to Shelly Harrison who was originally meant to play a supporting role in the
					Duke Nukem game.[1][2] In April 2014, a website NoGumNeeded.com was launched by Interceptor Entertainment that showed a countdown.[3]
					The game was revealed with the title Bombshell in development for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 on May 14, 2014 along with a 
					trailer and was scheduled to be released in 2015. Some details about the gameplay and the protagonist Shelly "Bombshell" Harrison were 
					revealed in the announcement. It was also announced that the game utilised the Unreal Engine and it will launch with modding tools.
					[1][4][5] Due to the negative reception to the trailer, 3D Realms started the development of the game from scratch.[2] The gameplay 
					trailer was released on March 2, 2015 during Game Developers Conference.[6] The E3 2015 trailer was released on June 25, 2015.[7] On 
					July 23, a ten-minute long video showing gameplay of the game was released during QuakeCon 2015.[8] On August 27, a game trailer of
					the boss battle against "Zeroth Guardian" was released during PAX Prime 2015.[9] The release of the Windows version of the game was 
					delayed to January 29, 2016 so as to give additional time for the developer to fix bugs.
