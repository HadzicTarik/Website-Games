					DmC: Devil May Cry is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Capcom for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. It is the fifth instalment of the Devil May Cry series, serving as a reboot. Announced in late 2010 during the Tokyo Game Show, the game is set in an alternate reality in the Devil May Cry series.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The game's story focuses on the player character Dante, a young man at the start of his saga. Dante is a Nephilim; half-angel, half-demon. He is partnered with his twin brother, Vergil, and is on a quest to kill the Demon King Mundus, who murdered their mother and condemned their father to banishment. Players can use Dante's iconic sword, Rebellion, and signature handguns, Ebony and Ivory, as well as a variety of other melee weapons and firearms to defeat enemies. The game also introduces Angel Mode and Devil Mode, which are modifiers to Dante's moveset.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The re-imagination of the Devil May Cry series was requested by Capcom, resulting in a total reboot. Capcom chose Ninja Theory to develop the game, assisting them to ensure that gameplay was reminiscent, but distinct, compared to previous titles. Early reaction to the game was widely negative, generally as a result of Dante's visual redesign; nevertheless, DMC received positive reviews from critics and players upon release. Critics praised the gameplay, artstyle and story of the game, as well as the redesigned Dante. The game initially failed to meet Capcom's sales expectation, but Capcom later revealed that the company was satisfied with the sales of the game.
				<p>
				<p>
					A DLC expansion for the game, titled Vergil's Downfall, which takes place after the main game and features Dante's brother Vergil as the playable character, was released on 23 March 2013. A remastered edition of the full game, titled DmC: Definitive Edition, running at 1080p/60fps and including all downloadable content, new costumes and new gameplay features such as a manual targeting system, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 10 March 2015.
