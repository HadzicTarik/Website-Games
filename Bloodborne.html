			<h1>Bloodborne</h1>
			<div id="opis">
				<p>
					Bloodborne (Japanese: ブラッドボーン Hepburn: Buraddobōn?) is an action role-playing video game directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, developed by FromSoftware, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.
					Officially announced at Sony's Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 conference, the game was released worldwide for the PlayStation 4 in March 2015.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Bloodborne follows the player character, the Hunter, through the fictional decrepit Gothic city of Yharnam, whose inhabitants have been afflicted with an abnormal blood-borne disease. Upon mysteriously awakening in Yharnam during the night of "The Hunt", the Hunter seeks out something known only as "Paleblood" for reasons unknown.[5] The Hunter begins to unravel Yharnam's intriguing mysteries while hunting down its many terrifying beasts. Eventually, the Hunter's
					objective is to locate and terminate the source of the plague, and escape the nightmare to return to the 'real world', known as the "Waking World".
				</p>
				<p>	
					The game is played from a third-person perspective, players control a fully customizable protagonist, and gameplay is focused on weapons-based combat and exploration. Players battle beastly and varied enemies, including bosses, using items such as swords and firearms, and journey through the story, exploring the game's different locations, interacting with non-player characters, collecting key items involved in the story, and discovering and unraveling the world's many mysteries. 
					Another trait of the game is its notorious difficulty, with some gaming publications calling it "brutal", while others said it was "difficult, but fair".
				</p>
				<p>
					Bloodborne began development in 2012 under the working title of Project Beast. Bearing many similarities to the Souls series of games, Bloodborne was partially inspired by classic H.P. Lovecraft and Dracula novels, and the architectural design of certain real world locations in places such as Romania and the Czech Republic. The decision by FromSoftware and director Miyazaki to create a new intellectual property (IP) and not another Souls game was made because Miyazaki wanted to create something "different"; at the same time, 
					Sony wanted a new IP to be made exclusively for the PlayStation 4. An expansion for the game, titled The Old Hunters, was released on November 24, 2015.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having been highly anticipated before being released, Bloodborne was met with critical acclaim upon release. Many critics applauded the game's atmosphere, detailed environments, and the overall visuals, the interconnected world design, the design of the characters, particularly that of the enemies, the fast-paced gameplay, the storyline and lore, and the soundtrack, which some touted as "glorious". Frame rate 
					issues and long load times at launch did, however, cause the game to draw some criticism. By September 2015, the game had sold over two million copies.
