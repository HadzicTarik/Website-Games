			<h1>Anno 2205</h1>
			<div id="opis">
				<p>
					Anno 2205 is a city-building and economic simulation game, with real-time strategy elements, developed by Ubisoft Blue Byte and published by Ubisoft. 2205 is the sixth game of the Anno series, 
					and was released on 3 November 2015. As with Anno 2070, the game is set in the future, with players having the opportunity to set up colonies on the moon.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Anno 2205 is a futuristic city-building video game similar to Anno 2070, as opposed to the previous installments which feature a historical setting. In the
					game, players take on the role of a leader from a corporation and must compete against other corporations in developing future technologies.[2] At the beginning of the game, players are tasked to build different metropolises on Earth. Population increases when more buildings are built, and players are tasked to satisfy and fulfill the needs of their citizens. Besides building houses, players must also produce goods and to build infrastructures like robot production facilities to maintain economy. These buildings can be relocated or moved around by players. Similar to SimCity, different parts can be added to buildings to enhance their functions.[3] Upgrading the production structures of these buildings can also improve their efficiency.[2] When citizens' demands were satisfied, they are able to produce more goods.[4] Players can also carry out a number of researches, such as putting funds and establishing research facilities to research ways to launch rockets to the moon. Once players finish the research, they can colonize the moon and build cities on its surface. Resources of the moon, such as Helium-3, are vital to the development of the cities on earth and can be sent back to earth.[5] Gameplay differs when players are establishing a city on the moon. As the moon lacks an atmosphere and 
					features a grimmer environment than Earth, building a city on the moon requires erecting asteroid shields, as well as unique greenhouses to produce food.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The game also introduces a session mode, which allows player to control and manage their cities both on Earth and on the moon at the same
					time. Resources vary in different sessions, as a result, players must set up trade routes between different colonies, so that resources
					and raw materials from a city can be used in another city.[7] The cities in the game are five times larger than the ones in its
					predecessors, and its supports at least eight different sessions. Pollution, as well as the underwater gameplay featured in Anno 2070 was removed from 2205 due to the addition of the moon as a playable environment. Bridges can be built to connect cities, while buildings can be upgraded via using different modules. Upon completion, the upgraded buildings can produce more goods.[6]
					Information in 2205 is presented visually instead of utilizing text like the previous installments. Citizens' demands appear as images or 
					icons. Happiness of citizens influence their actions. If they are happy, they can be seen travelling around the city. However, if they are 
					not, they will abandon their buildings and leave. Multiple camera angles are available for players to use. They can zoom in and zoom out, or to use pre-defined cameras to view the city. The structure of the game's story is also overhauled, in which players are not forced to complete the missions, and that players can choose to complete it during the free play.
