			<h1>Battlefield - Hardline</h1>
			<div id="opis">
				<p>
					Battlefield Hardline is a first-person shooter video game developed by Visceral Games in collaboration with EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts. It was
					released in March 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Unlike the previous games in the Battlefield series, Hardline
					focuses on crime, heist and policing elements instead of military warfare.
					Upon release, the game received a mixed critical reception, with critics praising the game's multiplayer mode, voice acting and accessibility,
					while criticizing the game's plot, stealth and narrative..</p>
				<p>	Battlefield Hardline was revealed on an EA blog post by Vice President and General Manager of Visceral Games, Steve Papoutsis. The game was due
					for announcement during E3 2014, but information was leaked early.[8] Unlike other games in the Battlefield franchise that feature military warfare, 
					Hardline features a "cops and robbers" gameplay style.[9] The leaked trailer refers to the game as Omaha. "Visceral started work on Battlefield 
					Hardline about a year before Dead Space 3 shipped," creative director Ian Milham has revealed, suggesting that the game may have entered development
					in early 2012.</p>
				<p>	On June 14, 2014, the Battlefield Hardline beta went public, coming after an official announcement at the 2014 Electronics Entertainment Expo that 
					the beta would be coming soon to PC and PlayStation 4. The beta ended on June 26, 2014.</p>
				<p>	During Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, EA confirmed that the game would be running at 1080p on the PlayStation 4 and was aiming to achieve the
					same resolution for the Xbox One version.[11] However, on March 8, 2015, Visceral Games revealed that the PlayStation 4 version would only run at 900p,
					with the Xbox One version running at 720p.[12] On February 3, 2015, the Battlefield Hardline beta became publicly active for all platforms.[13] It was
					reported that 7 million people participated in the open beta and it was met with positive reception from both critics and players.[14] On February 24, 
					2015, Electronic Arts confirmed that the game had been declared gold, indicating it was being prepared for production and release.</p>
