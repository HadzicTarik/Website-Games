			<h1>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</h1>
			<div id="opis">
				<p>
					Mirror's Edge Catalyst is a first-person action-adventure game in which players take control of Faith Connors as she progresses through a 
					futuristic city called Glass. Similar to the original Mirror's Edge, players traverse the city using aspects of urban exploration and parkour 
					movements to complete missions and evade enemies or knock them off of their feet. Players can also make use of environmental objects such as 
					zip-lines and ledges to travel across buildings. When players mark an objective on their map, Faith's "runner vision" is activated and some scenery
					items automatically highlight in red. These act as indicators to players whether a structure is climbable or not and as guides to lead players towards
					their objective.[3] The use of levels and linear gameplay found in the first Mirror's Edge has been replaced with an open-world, free-roaming 
					environment. This gives players more freedom in traversal, allowing for the use of multiple paths to reach one's objective.[4] In addition to 
					the campaign's mission, side activities such as time trials, races and environmental puzzles will be featured. DICE also promises that no loading 
					screen will be included in the final game, allowing for freedom to travel within all areas without loading delays. Additionally, items called
					Gridleaks can be found across the world that can be collected by players.</p>
				<p>	Combat mechanics of the game received an overhaul and a new combat system was developed as traversal is greatly emphasized in the game.[4]
					Also, though only used sparingly in the previous game, Mirror's Edge Catalyst has removed the use of guns by the player altogether, focusing on
					Faith's running and parkour movements and quick melee-style attacks to take down or evade her enemies.[6] According to Sara Jansson, the senior
					producer of the game, the combat and fighting featured will be an extension to the game's movement instead of a separated set.[7] When Faith is
					performing a finishing move, the game switches to a third-person perspective.</p>
				<p>	Multiplayer features are also included. Instead of having any co-operative multiplayer or competitive multiplayer mode, the game features synchronous
					multiplayer in which players' actions in the game can affect the world for other players' games. Leaderboard for races will also be featured.</p>
