					Final Fantasy XIII (ファイナルファンタジーXIII Fainaru Fantajī Sātīn?) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later for Microsoft Windows. Released in Japan in December 2009 and worldwide in March 2010, it is the thirteenth major installment in the Final Fantasy series. The game includes fast-paced combat, a new system for the series for determining which abilities are developed for the characters called "Crystarium", and a customizable "Paradigm" system to control which abilities 
					are used by the characters. Final Fantasy XIII includes elements from the previous games in the series, such as summoned monsters, chocobos, and airships.

					The game takes place in the fictional floating world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge of civilians who have supposedly come into contact with Pulse, the much-feared world below. The former soldier Lightning begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally 
					against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion.

					Development began in 2004 and the game was first announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2006. Final Fantasy XIII is the flagship title of the Fabula Nova Crystallis collection of Final Fantasy games and is the first game to use Square Enix's Crystal Tools engine. Final Fantasy XIII received mostly positive reviews from video game publications, which praised the game's graphics, presentation, and battle system. The game's story received a mixed response from reviewers, and its linearity compared to previous games in the series was mostly criticized. Selling 1.7 million copies in Japan in 2009, Final Fantasy XIII became the fastest-selling title in the history of the series. As of January 2013, the game has sold over 6.6 million copies worldwide.[3] The Windows PC version has sold about 500,000 copies according to SteamSpy putting it at 7.1 million copies sold worldwide before iOS & Android sales. A sequel, titled Final Fantasy XIII-2, was released in December 2011 in Japan and in February 2012 in North America and PAL regions. A second sequel, titled Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, which 
					concludes Lightning's story and the Final Fantasy XIII saga,[4] was released in November 2013 in Japan and in February 2014 in North America and PAL regions.
